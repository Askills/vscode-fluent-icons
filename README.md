# Fluent Icons for Visual Studio Code

[Product icons themes](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/product-icon-theme) allow theme authors to customize the icons used in VS Code's built-in views: all icons except file icons (covered by file icon themes) and icons contributed by extensions. This extension uses [Fluent Icons](https://www.figma.com/community/file/836835755999342788/Microsoft-Fluent-System-Icons).
